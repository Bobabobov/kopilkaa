  "prompt": "A highly detailed spritesheet for a golden coin spinning animation. The spritesheet should be arranged in a 6x4 grid (6 columns, 4 rows), where each individual frame is 256x256 pixels. The total image resolution must be 1536x1024 pixels (width: 6*256, height: 4*256).\n\n**Coin Appearance:** The coin is golden, depicted with a realistic, slightly aged metallic texture, featuring subtle highlights and shadows that suggest depth and a sense of volume. The rim of the coin has clearly defined, sharp serrated edges.\n\n**Coin Faces:**\n- One side (front) features the number '1' embossed in the center, encircled by a finely detailed laurel wreath.\n- The other side (back) features the Russian Ruble symbol (₽) embossed in the center, also encircled by a finely detailed laurel wreath.\n\n**Animation Sequence:** The spritesheet should depict a smooth, continuous 360-degree rotation of the coin. The first five frames in the top row (from left to right) should specifically illustrate the coin starting face-on with the '1' side, progressively rotating to an angled view, then almost fully on its edge, then completely on its edge, and finally beginning to reveal the '₽' side from an angle. The subsequent frames should continue this rotation, eventually showing the '₽' side face-on and completing the full spin, ensuring seamless transitions between all 24 frames.",
